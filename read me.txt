1)Initially i started using the jupyter notebook from my local computer it was taking too much of time while cleaning the text,
so I had to switch to google colab, the data which I had generated from my local jupyter notebook I had upload them in colab

2)after uploading I created a data frame using the data

3)after this I had to clean the text for which I wrote two functions for cleaning "cleaner","no_punc"

4)after this step I onverted the words into vectors because machine learning models throw error when the string data is given as input

5)and later I built a Decision Tree model because this problem was about classification decision tree is good at solving classifiaction
problems

6)and later the model with X, y variables and got a score of 100%
